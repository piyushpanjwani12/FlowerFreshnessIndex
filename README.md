# FlowerFreshnessIndex

-> The technology used is Opencv with java

-> The input images are given.(flower1.png, flower2.png, flower3.png, flower4.png, flower5.png)

      The jar file initially requires two reference images
      1.) Image of a fresh flower(let "flower1.png")
      2.) Image of the wilted flower(let "flower4.png")
      Then using these images, a reference is made.
      For calculating the freshness, a new image is put in the software, and its freshness index is calculated and presented.
      
 -> The output is generated in the form of a slider. Also a freshness percent is reported.
